# TestMe

A simple application to test yourself for exams

## Description
Have you ever been anxious about an exam? Let me guess, you studied the entire book,
took notes, memos and stuff like that, but you still don't feel confident about it.

So take a break, install TestMe and write question topics that could be asked. Topics will
be randomly chosen, and you will check your knowledge about them.

You can mark topics as done, and they will not be chosen.

## Usage
This app is currently in alpha stage so expect bugs. I will soon publish TestMe on Google Play and App Store, but if
you want you can enjoy a free ad-free experience by building the app yourself:

### Requirements
- Flutter SDK  [Download link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
### Build
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lucamadd/TestMe.git
$ cd TestMe
$ flutter build apk                          //Build an Android APK file from your app.
$ flutter build ios                          //Build an iOS application bundle (Mac OS X host only).
```
