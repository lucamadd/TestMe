# TestMe

A simple application to test yourself for exams

## Usage
Have you ever been anxious about an exam? Let me guess, you studied the entire book,
took notes, memos and stuff like that, but you still don't feel confident about it.

So take a break, install TestMe and write question topics that could be asked. Topics will
be randomly chosen, and you will check your knowledge about them.

You can mark topics as done, and they will not be chosen.
